# RullanSavin2021
Demo from A sampling-based circuit for optimal decision making (Rullán Buxó and Savin, Neurips 2021). 
Notebook walks through how to replicate Fig. 2. Repository includes function for the marginalization circuit (marginalization_network.py), code for plotting (plot_BSN_neurips.py) and code for inference in a linear Gaussian model and for generating Langevin samples from a distribution (hmcmc_neurips.py).
